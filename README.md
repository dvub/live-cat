# Live-cat

This program prints the contents of a file to the standard output, similarly to the `cat` command on linux. In addition, this program also watches the file and prints the file contents whenever the file changes, effectively providing a live view of the file.

## Why?

I made this program to assist in debugging programs that print to a file. (I may never use this myself)

## Usage

Run with `--help` to see more information on usage.

## Installation

Currently, there are no releases available on Github. So if you'd like to use this, you'll have to clone the repo and then build it yourself.
